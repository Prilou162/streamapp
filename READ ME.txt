# STREAMLATAM — Creator x Brand Profile MVP (Premium Demo)

A **premium, brand-friendly MVP** that shows how a streamer can maintain a single profile and instantly power:
- a dynamic dashboard (insights + readiness),
- a clean public-facing brand profile,
- and a “mini media kit” export — **without any backend**.

Built to be **easy to review, easy to demo, easy to sell**.

---

## Why this MVP exists

Most creator/streamer tools fail at the first 10 seconds:
brands don’t understand the creator fast enough, and creators don’t want friction.

STREAMLATAM solves that with a single source of truth:
**one profile → multiple brand-ready outputs**.

## What you can demo in 60 seconds

1. Open `profile.html`  
2. Edit the streamer profile + base data  
3. Click **Save / Update**  
4. Open `dashboard.html` → see KPIs/insights update  
5. Open `profile-public.html` → see the brand profile update instantly  

Everything stays synced via `localStorage`.
